Description About “BodyShape” 

   This project is a responsive and visually appealing gymnasium website built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, Font Awesome, Google Fonts and modern web development tools. It is designed to showcase gym services, fitness plans, trainers, and facilities in a structured and user-friendly way. The website highlights both aesthetic design and functional layout with responsive features, ensuring a smooth experience across devices. 

Completing this project was both exciting and challenging for me. It took around 22 hours over two days to finish. Since I was new to Tailwind CSS, making the design responsive and handling spacing, alignment, grids, and hover effects was quite difficult at first. I also had to learn and apply some new feature and tools like grid divide border, polygon etc. to complete and enhance the design. Another challenge was learning Git and GitHub from you tube to push the complete project online. Although these tasks were tough, they helped me explore new skills and gain more confidence in web development. 

This project gave me a great opportunity to practice real-world web design skills. I not only built a complete gymnasium website but also learned new tools and technologies along the way. Overall, it was a valuable learning experience that improved both my technical knowledge and confidence in web development
